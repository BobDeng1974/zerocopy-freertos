## Notes

- There is a resource filter on the 'portable' directory to exclude all but the tiva-specific files.
- SW_ROOT is defined under the assumption that TivaWare is installined in the same directory (ti/) as CCS.
- There are probably other Windows-specific definitions that need to be generalized.
